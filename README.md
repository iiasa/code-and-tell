## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small code snippets presented during the MESSAGEix
weekly meetings.

The idea is that each presentation is centered around a jupyter notebook. In case a single
notebook is sufficient, the suggested naming convention is
`YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-the-topic.ipynb`. If you have multiple files, please create a directory
using the same name and put the material there.

Please also make sure that the `requirements.txt` is kept up to date.
